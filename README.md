# Make Lore is a opinionated Python cli-utility for automating worldbuilding for creatives.

The goals of this project are **currently** as follows:
   - [Â ] Let users set a base folder path using an `init` command
     - [ ] Create base folders for Places, People, and Items
   - [ ] Let users pass arguments like `village` or `country` and create the corect nested folder with a "Main Info.md"  
     - [ ] Take parameters pertaining to the correct parent folders & name for the nested folder 

## Use cases

- You're writing a fiction novel and want to have a place to put all your background info on this or that

- You're a GM/DM for a TTRPG-style setting and want to neatly organise all you game notes so you can focus on making your sessions fun for everyone playing

- You're doing any sort of world building and want to do less clicking and file management in general.

## Why Markdown files?
The reason most of the folders that are made use Markdown files (.md) is because it means you can use a variety of tools of your choice to actually edit the files that are made. Here's a few options:

 - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): A great tool that helps you visiualise the connections between all your notes and lore using markdown link syntax and a handy graph view. Also has a wide variety of handy plugins! (This is the one I use personally)
 - [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/): One of the best markdown editors for people who love neat file structures and helpful for setting daily, weekly, or monthly goals
 - [Typora](https://typora.io/): A great, minimal, open-source markdown editor/reader for local files like the ones Make Lore creates
